<h1> Bonjour! </h1>
        <p class="lead">I am a final year student at Singapore Management University, double majoring in Smart-City Management & Technology and Technology for Business Solutions (Business Analytics). <br><br> I have accumulated experiences from school and work in business analysis, project management, spatial analysis, data analytics, web development and basic knowledge on cybersecurity, machine learning, financial accounting and algorithmic fairness and bias. <br><br> I am passionate about giving back to society, willing to use my skill sets and knowledges to improve or bring new ideas to organisations which I have the opportunity to work with. Outside of work, I am also passionate about film criticism and pursuing academia learning (soft and technical skills, and head and heart knowledge).</p>
